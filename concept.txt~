DipSeq
Sequencer based on a front panel PCB full of DIP switches and LED strips
Split into control and DIP panels, 1 control panel can serve 1-4 DIP panels.

DIP panel:
- 10 HP
- 2 columns of 32 DIP switches (4xDIP-8 piano style), column of LEDS in middle.
- 4 jacks: 1 pulse out, 1 legato out per column

DIP panel front to back PCB interconnect:
- Problem is where to accommodate standard 0.1" thru-hole headers
- 5 (mayyybe 6) pins under each DIP switch might be ok >> 40/48 pins 
- signals: 32x step select, LEG_A, LEG_B (raw unbuffered versions), LED GND, signal GND?

DIP back PCB to control panel interconnect:
- try for compatibilty with other (CV) sequencer concepts
- e.g.: 3 select lines (binary coded), 4 "group select" lines (1 out of 4
  active at any given time), GND, logic/LED supplies?


Control panel:
- Speed pot
- Sequence length pot
- Loop / single-shot switch
- Start button
- Stop button
- Clock in jack (normaled to internal clock)
- Clock out jack (to sync other sequencers to DIPseq clock)
- Start in jack (aka reset / restart on 1 / wake-up) - x2?
- Stop in jack
- "End of sequence" out jack
- Loop in jack (normaled to loop/single-shot switch)
- Sequence length CV in jack?
- Staircase out jack?
- Clock enable in jack?
